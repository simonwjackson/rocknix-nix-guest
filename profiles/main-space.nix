# Mod+d fuzzel, Mod+g games-launcher, workspaces 1-9, focus/move/layout),
# and `exec foot` so a cold boot lands the user on something interactive
# instead of a black screen. The audio/Steam/Cemu module composition is
# unchanged.

  # before sway is even reached. wlroots's libseat backend acquires its

  # unit binds in) when sway initialises the DRM session, so there is no
